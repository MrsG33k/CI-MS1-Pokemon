-   ### Design Reference
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -    I have decided, for user familiarity to use colours associated with Pokémon. 
        - **Pokémon Blue Colour**: `#354FA0`
        - **Pokémon Yellow Colour**: `#FBCA03`
        - **Poké Ball Red Colour**: `#FE0004`
        - **Poké Ball Black Colour**: `#010103`
        - **Display Font**: [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P)
        - **Body Font**: [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand)
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/images/PokemonPalette.png" width="400px"
                alt="Image of colour palette for the website">  
            
            <figcaption>Image contains the colour palette chosen for the Pokmeon website</figcaption>
        </figure>

    -   #### Typography
        - Quicksand font is the main body font used throughout website with Sans Serif being used as a backup font if the Quicksand font fails to load correctly. Quicksand is a modern, sans serif font which will be clear and easy to read on the screeen.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

*   ### Wireframes
    - #### Homepage Wireframe
        - **Here are the wireframes for both desktop and mobile for the homepage:**
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/images/HomePage.png" width="400px"
                alt="Image of desktop wireframe for homepage">

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    **1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about Pokémon.**
      - The homepage opens with a clear hero section, welcome message, and a prominent call to action that immediately introduces the site’s purpose — to explore the Pokémon world. The use of themed visuals and a friendly tone makes the goal of the site obvious to new visitors.
    
    **2. As a First Time Visitor, I want a navigation menu that is easy to use  so that I can find the information I need quickly.**
      - The homepage opens with a clear hero section, welcome message, and a prominent call to action that immediately introduces the site’s purpose — to explore the Pokémon world. The use of themed visuals and a friendly tone makes the goal of the site obvious to new visitors.
    
    **3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to read about different types of Pokémon so that I can understand their strengths and weaknesses.**
      - The Types page provides an easy-to-navigate list of Pokémon types with custom styling, clear headings, images to demonstrate the type icons and example Pokémon. It includes descriptions, strong/weak matchups, and an effectiveness matrix to visually reinforce learning.


-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    **1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find new or updated content easily so that I can stay engaged with the website.**
      - The homepage features a “Fact of the Day” section that can be updated with rotating trivia, offering returning users something fresh. The overall structure supports future content additions like new Pokémon generations or expanded quizzes.
    
    **2. As a Returning Visitor, I want links to external Pokemon resources so that I can expand my knowledge.**
      - A link to the official Pokémon website is included in the footer, providing an easy path for users to explore official content beyond the scope of the site. In the future, I would like to add community features and a wiki of external content.


### Further Testing
 - #### PageSpeed Insights
    I ran the index page through Pagespeed insights and have posted the results below. The output from this showed that in the future, to aid performance I should convert all images to WEBP formats. 

    <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/Audit_Desktop.png" width="400px"
            alt="Image of Pagespeed insight results for the mobile">
        <figcaption>Image of the PageSpeed insights for the desktop version of the homepage</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br>

    <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/Audit_Mobile.png" width="400px"
            alt="Image of Pagespeed insight results for the mobile">
        <figcaption>Image of the PageSpeed insights for the mobile version of the homepage</figcaption>
    </figure>

- #### General Testing 
    - All features were manually tested across the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
    - The website was also tested on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Chrome DevTools, PageSpeed Insights and [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/).
    - All navigation links were tested to ensure they scroll or direct to the correct section or page.
    - All images and fonts load correctly.
    - The quiz radio buttons and layout were checked for accessibility and responsive alignment.

- #### User Testing
    As part of the final sign off of the website, I asked a range of users to test the website both on Desktop and Mobile and I have fixed some feedback and issues as follows:

    **1. Charmander Text Issues**
     On the homepage, the Charmander text was displaying differently to the other Pokémon names.
    <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/Bug_Charmander.png" width="400px"
            alt="Image of Pokemon text not displaying propberly">
    </figure>
    This turned out to be a **h** issue. The incorrect Heading level was used on the Charmander text meaning it displayed incorrectly.   <br>
    

    **2. Pokedex - Black Background**
    On the Pokedex page, when hovering over the cards a black background appears which shouldn't be there. 
    <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/Bug_BlackText.png" width="200px"
            alt="Image of Pokemon text not displaying properly">
    </figure>
    This was due to using a black bg hover effect on the PokeTypes list. I fixed this by using a parent selector on the hover styles so that it would only effect the type list, not any hover items.

    <code>  

        #type-list .list-group-item:hover {  

        background-color: #343a40 !important;  

        border-color: #343a40 !important;  

        color: white !important;  

        box-shadow: 0 0 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.50);  

        } 
    </code>  

    **3. Quiz Text Alignment**
    On the Quiz page, the users reported not liking the text alignment being centred in the Quiz section. 
    <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/Bug_QuizAlign.png" width="400px"
            alt="Image of Quiz Page text aligning centrally">
    </figure>  

    This was fixed by adding the **text-start** code to the section code for the quiz content. 

    **4. Missing call to action**
    On the PokeTypes page, users reported not having a call to action at the bottom of the page to lead them to the Quiz page. This was inconsistent to the other pages. 
    <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/Bug_CTA.png" width="400px"
            alt="Image of missing CTA on the PokeTypes page">
    </figure> 

    This was fixed by adding the CTA section and amending it as per the other pages of the website.  



### Known Bugs / Issues

- On some mobile browsers, custom font rendering (Press Start 2P) may take a moment to load, which causes a slight delay in text styling.
- The "disabled" submit button on the quiz is intentionally non-functional due to project requirements restricting JavaScript use.
- I am aware that on mobile displays the font for the carousel shows white and is not clear, this is to be fixed in future development.



## Future Improvements

- Add in a matrix for the Pokemon type Vs type compatibility. I tried to implement this during the initial project, however it wasn't easy to ensure full accessibility, so I am adding it as a future development instead.
- Add JavaScript functionality to make the quiz fully interactive and display score live.
- Include additional Pokémon generations in the Pokédex.
- Expand type descriptions with animations or infographics.


## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
