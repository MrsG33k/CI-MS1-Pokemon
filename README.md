## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want a navigation menu that is easy to use  so that I can find the information I need quickly

-   ### Design Reference
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -    I have decided, for user familiarity to use colours associated with Pokémon. 
        - **Pokémon Blue Colour**: `#354FA0`
        - **Pokémon Yellow Colour**: `#FBCA03`
        - **Poké Ball Red Colour**: `#FE0004`
        - **Poké Ball Black Colour**: `#010103`
        - **Display Font**: [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P)
        - **Body Font**: [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand)
        ![Image contains the colour palette chosen for the Pokmeon website](assets/images/PokemonPalette.png)

    -   #### Typography
        - Quicksand font is the main body font used throughout website with Sans Serif being used as a backup font if the Quicksand font fails to load correctly. Quicksand is a modern, sans serif font which will be clear and easy to read on the screeen.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

*   ### Wireframes
    - #### Homepage Wireframe
        - **Here are the wireframes for both desktop and mobile for the homepage:**

    - #### PokeTypes Wireframe
        - **I have also included a mock up of how the Poketypes page might look using an accordian to show the different Poketypes.**
